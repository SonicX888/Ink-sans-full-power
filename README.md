# Ink-sans-full-power
Undertale fan-game made in 2022 when I was 14 (not finished). It was first made on Scratch and then turned into different versions.

Ink Sans has had enough of you and uses his full power to kill you. If your HP reach 0, you die.

Only a demo is available right now.

Phase 1: complete

Ink Sans is only using Sanses to attack you, just like the original one.

Phase 2: complete

Ink Sans is now also using Papyruses and Charas

Phase 3: complete

Ink Sans uses stronger Sanses

Phase 4: W.I.P

Ink Sans is really angry and uses A LOT of characters to kill you

Phase 5: not started

Ink Sans uses the help of gods

Phase 6: not started

Ink Sans is weakened and uses less strong characters, yet they are still very strong ones
